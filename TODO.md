# TODO

## Bugs / Missing

- [x] ~~**`cmdWhere` non-deterministic with duplicate paths** — now iterates `config.SortedNames()` for deterministic first match~~ *(Mar 5)*
- [x] ~~**No request body size limit on API** — added `http.MaxBytesReader` (10 MB) on `/api/import`~~ *(Mar 5)*
- [x] ~~**`handleGitStatus` has no timeout** — uses `exec.CommandContext` with 10-second deadline~~ *(Mar 5)*
- [x] ~~**Duplicate load-find-place pattern** — extracted `lookupPlace()` helper, used by `cmdGo`, `cmdCode`, `cmdShell`~~ *(Mar 5)*
- [x] ~~**`--shell` flag not validated** — `resolveShell()` now rejects unknown shells with error message~~ *(Mar 5)*
