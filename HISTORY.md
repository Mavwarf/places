### Stable dashboard sorting

Sorting in the dashboard now uses the place name as a tiebreaker when the
primary sort key is equal. Previously, places with the same value (e.g.
never-used places sorted by "last used") would shuffle randomly on each
3-second auto-refresh. Affects "most used", "last used", and "added" sort modes.

### External links open in system browser

Footer links (author website, GitHub repo) in the dashboard now open in the
system default browser instead of navigating inside the Wails WebView. A global
click interceptor catches all `<a target="_blank">` clicks and routes them
through a new `/api/open-url` endpoint, which validates the URL (https only)
and launches the platform browser (`cmd /c start` on Windows, `open` on macOS,
`xdg-open` on Linux).

### Global hotkey

Press **Win+Alt+P** from anywhere to open the places dashboard. If the
dashboard is on a different virtual desktop, you are switched to that desktop
first, then the window is shown.

- Registers `Win+Alt+P` via `RegisterHotKey` on a dedicated OS thread
- Finds the Wails window by title, queries its desktop via
  `GetWindowDesktopNumber`, switches with `GoToDesktopNumber`
- Graceful degradation: if the DLL is missing, the window still shows (no
  desktop switch); if the hotkey is already registered, the app runs without it

### Desktop switch button

Each place row in the desktop app now shows a **→** button next to the virtual
desktop dropdown (D1–D4). Clicking it switches to that desktop without
launching any tool. The button only appears when a desktop is assigned.

- New `/api/switch-desktop` endpoint calls `launcher.SwitchDesktop(n)`
- Button hidden by default, shown via CSS `.visible` class when `p.desktop > 0`

### App icon recolor

Changed the app icon background from blue (Tokyo Night accent) to orange,
matching the notify app icon. Same white "P" on orange circle.

### `p list` indentation fix

Fixed misaligned output when mixing favorite and non-favorite places. Non-
favorite entries now pad with two spaces to match the width of the ★ marker.

### Virtual desktop support

Each place can be assigned a Windows virtual desktop (1–4) via `places desktop
<name> <n>`. When launching a tool (PowerShell, Claude, cmd, VS Code, Explorer)
from the desktop app or system tray, the app switches to that desktop first using
`VirtualDesktopAccessor.dll`.

- CLI: `p desktop api 2` assigns desktop 2, `p desktop api 0` clears it
- `p list` shows a `[D2]` badge for places with a desktop set
- `p list --json` includes `"desktop"` field
- Desktop app: dropdown selector (—, D1–D4) per place row
- System tray: submenus switch desktop before launching
- New `internal/desktop` package (copied from notify tool)
- `launcher.SwitchDesktop(n)` helper called before `Detach()`

### Auto-refresh in desktop app

The dashboard now polls `/api/places` every 3 seconds. Places added via CLI
appear automatically without needing to interact with the app.

### Usage tracking from app and tray

Clicking any action button (PS, cl, VS, >_, dir) in the desktop app or system
tray now records a use — increments `use_count` and updates `last_used_at`. The
UI refreshes immediately after clicking, so the use count and sort order update
in place.

### Interactive arrow-key select

`places select` (and `p` / `p select`) now uses an interactive cursor-based menu
instead of numbered input. Arrow keys move the highlight, Enter confirms, Esc or
`q` cancels. The selected line shows bold green name and cyan path; other lines
are dimmed. A footer hint shows available keys. The menu cleans up after itself
(all lines cleared on exit).

Implementation uses platform-specific raw terminal input: `ReadConsoleInputW`
with virtual key codes on Windows, termios with VT100 escape sequences on Unix.
No external dependencies.

### Init command

`places init` is a one-command setup that auto-detects the current shell,
installs the shell hook, and on Windows also installs `p.bat` for cmd.exe.
Skips hooks that are already installed (no error). Prints next steps
(execution policy, profile reload).

### Edit command

`places edit [editor]` opens `places.json` in an editor. Priority:
explicit argument > `$EDITOR` > `$VISUAL` > `notepad` (Windows) / `vi` (Unix).
Example: `places edit notepad`, `places edit code`.

### Fuzzy matching

`places go` (and `p <name>`) now falls back to substring matching when no
exact match is found. `p not` matches `notify` if it's the only place
containing "not". Ambiguous matches (multiple results) still show an error.

### Color output

`places list` now uses ANSI color codes: place names in green, paths in cyan,
stats in dim, and `[missing!]` warnings in yellow.

### Path separator normalization

All stored paths are normalized to OS-native separators on load via
`filepath.Clean()`. On Windows, forward slashes are converted to backslashes.
Existing paths with mixed separators are fixed automatically on the next save.

### Relative path resolution

`places add name .` and similar relative paths are now resolved to absolute
paths via `filepath.Abs()` before saving. Previously `.` was stored literally.

### Select sorted by recent use

`places select` now shows places sorted by most recently used first, with
never-used places at the bottom (sorted alphabetically). `places list` remains
alphabetical.

### Usage stats

`places stats` shows a quick summary:

```
Places: 5
Total uses: 15
Most used: notify (12 uses)
Least used: eco (0 uses)
```

### Rename command

`places rename <old> <new>` (alias: `mv`) renames a saved place while
preserving all statistics (added_at, use_count, last_used_at).

### Path validation

`places list` and `places select` now check if each saved path still exists on
disk. Missing directories are flagged with `[missing!]` in the output.

### Auto-name on add

`places add` without a name argument derives the name from the current
directory's basename. E.g. running `places add` in `/cli_tools/notify` saves it
as `notify`.

### cmd.exe support

Added `cmd` as a supported shell type. `places shell-hook install --shell cmd`
creates a `p.bat` file next to the `places.exe` binary. The batch file handles:

- `p <name>` — `for /f` captures `places go` output and `cd /d` to it
- `p` / `p select` — runs `places select` with stdout redirected to a temp file
  (preserves stdin for interactive input), then reads and `cd`s to the result
- `p add/rm/list/...` — passthrough to `places`

Uninstall with `places shell-hook uninstall --shell cmd` (deletes `p.bat`).

### CLAUDE.md

Added project conventions file covering build/deploy, documentation rules, shell
hook update workflow, and coding conventions.

### go.mod version fix

Fixed `go 1.24.0` to `go 1.24` to match the required format.

### Shell hook passthrough

The `p` function now acts as a full wrapper for `places`. Subcommands like `add`,
`rm`, `list`, `ls`, `help`, and `shell-hook` pass through directly to the binary.
`p` and `p select` both run the interactive selector and cd to the result.
Anything else is treated as a place name and resolved via `places go`.

### PowerShell support

Shell hook install/uninstall now supports PowerShell alongside bash/zsh. On
Windows, auto-detection defaults to PowerShell. The `--shell` flag allows
targeting a specific shell.

- PowerShell requires `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser RemoteSigned`
- PowerShell Core (pwsh) and Windows PowerShell have separate profile paths
- Both must be updated when the snippet changes

### Interactive select

`places select` shows a numbered list of saved places and prompts for a choice.
The menu and prompt go to stderr, the selected path goes to stdout — this lets
the shell wrapper capture the path while the user sees the menu.

### Usage statistics

Each place now tracks when it was added, how many times it has been used, and
when it was last used. Stats are shown inline in `places list`:

```
  notify  C:/dev/repos/private/cli_tools/notify  (added Feb 28, 3 uses, last: Feb 28 14:10)
  places  C:/dev/repos/private/cli_tools/places  (added Feb 28, never used)
```

Usage is recorded on every `places go` and `places select` call.

### Config format migration

The config format changed from `map[string]string` to `map[string]*Place` to
support per-place statistics. The old format auto-migrates on first load — plain
string values are wrapped in a `Place` struct with `added_at` set to the
migration time.

### Initial release

Core CLI tool with `add`, `list`, `go`, `rm` commands. Config stored as JSON at
`~/.config/places/places.json` with auto-created directory. Shell hook uses
marker-based injection (`# BEGIN/END places shell-hook`) for clean
install/uninstall. Follows patterns from the `notify` CLI tool: manual arg
parsing, `fatal()` helper, stdlib only.
